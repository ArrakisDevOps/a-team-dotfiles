Arrakis DevOps Team dotfiles

We plan to share easily reusable automated or semi-automated scripts, processes to setup a local DevOps environment.
Target platforms are Windows WSL2, Linux, Mac. 

We would group components into DevOps toolset categories.

- basic setup like git, editor, shell etc.
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Public Cloud provider like AWS
- Python dev env
- Go
- AWS
- Azure
and more...

We could even create dev containers for each specific bigger components or an all-in-one if possible.
